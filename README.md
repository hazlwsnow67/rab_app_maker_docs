### Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```text
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %} Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours. {% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}

```text
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

{% endcode %}
